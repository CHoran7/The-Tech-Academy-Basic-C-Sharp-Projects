# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

This repository contains basic C# projects that I created or followed along with for various assignments in The Tech Academy's C# course.
Most of these projects involve one basic concept of C# programming being demonstrated. They may also be an assignment dedicated to 
combining a few of the ideas we learned in the course.
