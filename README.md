# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects

This repository contains basic C# projects that I created or followed along with for various assignments in The Tech Academy's C# course.
Most of these projects involve one basic concept of C# programming being demonstrated. They may also be an assignment dedicated to 
combining a few of the ideas we learned in the course.

The most impressive projects in this repository are the TwentyOneGame and the MVC projects. The MVC projects contain small example web applications that we built to get used to MVC structure. The TwentyOneGame is a culmination of most of the concepts learned throughout
the course. It is a function game of 21 with lots of features to demonstrate ideas from object oriented programming.
